  //print to the screen
  cc.showCollegeCourse(); //now print to the screen!
  lc.showLabCourse(); //print to the screen!



//EXPAND THIS PROGRAM 
/*
  1.write a setLabFee and a getLabFee method
  2. in int main() prompt the user for a labFee
  3. set the new lab fee
  4. print the new lab fee to the screen
  5. reprint lc to the screen "what does the tuition value look like now?"
  6. Share the URL and downloaded .zip to EC item 15
  7. Break until 1:40 pm 
  8. Then unit 5 assignment
